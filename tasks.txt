General:
+ Try to train and compare results with the ones in the paper 
	- WIP - In Colab - much better

+ We need to know how the data looks like and how users would create similar datasets. What's the format of annotation files, what is important.
	- txt/csv with a '\t', ' ', ',' separator. Each series on a column. Should be the same length (pad with 0/smth if data not available)

+ It needs to work if all data is placed in a single folder on disk
	- Done

Inference requirements:
	+ We need to be able to load a set of saved weights (from arbitrary local path)
		- Done. using load_weights, --initial_weights file path and first_epoch=True 

	+ We need to be able to initialize historical data
		- Done. Needs some refining before using

	+ Return predictions for the next K samples
		- ?? TODO:Fix data generator?
 	
Train requirements:
	+ We need to be able to load initialization weights (if none provided, start from random) before training
		- Done. use --initial_weights to point to file

	+ We need to be able to specify an arbitrary number of epochs to run
		- Done.

	+ We need to be able to compute metrics on a validation dataset (provided in paper)
		- Done. Details.

  + We would like to have a certain granularity within this API:
	+ prepare_train(train_split, test_split)
		- Done. By using the --split param, the data gets split into [split] % validation, [split] % testing, rest for training 

	+ run_single_epoch()  # Uses train_split, outputs loss
		- Done. TEST IT //can also just run as --epochs=1

	+ run_validation()  # Uses test_split <validation_split?>, outputs metrics
		- Done.

	+ save_weights(path)
		- Done. Takes (session, model, path, name). Could add some unique ID to the name

	+ cleanup_train()
		- delete tfrecods? free GPU mem

Training results:
	+ Solar
		- TBA
	+ MUSE
		- TBD
	+ Traffic
		- TBD
	+ Electricity, lpd5
		- meh

Extras:
	+ pls add epoch progress bar - need total data len for this 
		- Done. added primitive pb (as batch counter)
	+ enable/disable/add validation every x epochs param
		-
	+ skip the save/load model every epoch 
		- Poss only if validation is disabled
	+ add tensorboard 
		- Can't, need tf 2.0
	+ Optimize for G Colab, save temp on HDD, not in drive, etc
		-
	+ script for plotting metrics 
		- DONE
	+ auto-tuned hyperparms script
		- ...
	+ attention_len > 16 => error. debug it
		-
	+ data unpacking differently in G Colab?????????????
	+ comm code
